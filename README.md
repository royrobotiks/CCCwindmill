# CCCwindmill

It's a little windmill which I designed in OpenScad and which I'll bring to the Chaos Communication Camp 2019. I hope that I can charge a powerbank with it. It is not fully developed and rather meant as a test bed, so let's see if this will work out.
On my Version, I'll install a little breadboard on the main body, so that I can try out different ways to handle the current which comes from  the generator.


Additional parts:

Main body:
* two ball bearings
* stepper motor as generator
* M10 threaded rod + 2 nuts
* little breadboard

Slipring:
* two 8mm long pieces of 22mm copper pipe
* two motor brushes
+ two small rubber bands

Hub:
* 7 screws, M4, 20mm with nuts
* 3 blades, e.g. cut out of Forex or Coroplast
